## HTML and CSS

Image below about how html and css work together.
<img src="https://geomoer.github.io//moer-base-r/assets/images/spotlights/html-css.png">

In a R markdown file you can just use html.

If you want to use css in a r markdown file, you can use the css option:

output:
  html_document:
    css: "style.css"
    
If you want to include multiple css files, you may list them in brackets.

output:
  html_document:
    css: ["style-1.css", "style-2.css"]
    
You can also use a css chunk to directly use the css in your r markdown file.

{css, echo=FALSE}
p {
  font-size: 20px;
}

The chunk option echo = false means that the css will be used on the html, but you will not see the chunk in the knitted file. We will use echo = True in the rest of the document to show the examples.

```{css, echo=TRUE}
p {
  font-size: 20px;
  font-family: "Times New Roman";
}

.example1 {
  color: blue;
}

.example2 {
  color: red;
}

.example3 {
  color: green;
}
```

You can also use divs to style specific elements instead of the whole document.

<div class ="example1">
example 1
</div>
<div class ="example2">
example 2 
</div>
<div class ="example3">
example 3 
</div>

See the cheat sheets below to see what markdown syntax will turn into in the final report.

## Flexdashboard

To install the flexdashboard, you can use the following code

install.packages("flexdashboard")

To load the flexdashboard package, you can use 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(flexdashboard)
```
You should also make sure that your output is in the form of a flexdashboard, you can do this by changing the output to flexdashboard::flex_dashboard. 

The goal of flexdashboard is to make it easy to create interactive dashboards for R, using R Markdown.

* Use R Markdown to publish a group of related data visualizations as a dashboard.

* Support for a wide variety of components including htmlwidgets; base, lattice, and grid graphics; tabular data; gauges and value boxes; and text annotations.

* Flexible and easy to specify row and column-based layouts. Components are intelligently re-sized to fill the browser and adapted for display on mobile devices.

* Storyboard layouts for presenting sequences of visualizations and related commentary.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(gss_cat, aes(race, tvhours, fill=race)) +geom_col()
```



You can add an input sidebar to a flexdashboard by adding the {.sidebar} attribute to a column, which indicates that it should be laid out flush to the left with a default width of 250 pixels and a special background color. Sidebars always appear on the left no matter where they are defined within the flow of the document.
